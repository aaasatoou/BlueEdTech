# BlueEdTech

Repository for display and storage of the educational content developed at Blue Edtech. This repository covers all modules of the data science track. Most notebooks here are purely for educational purposes.

For well structured and documented projects, see the projects related to the Bootcamps held at BlueEdTech itself:

- [Bootcamp 1 - ECOMMERCE SERVICES](https://github.com/anachavesv8/Bootcamp_Blue)
- [Bootcamp 2 - COVID Time Series, Sentiment Analysis and DashBoard (Currently In Development)](https://github.com/aaasatoou/bootcamp_blue_Projeto2)

Both projects are developed in groups, soon i will start developing solo projects.

All documents (this file being the only exception) are in Brazilian Portuguese.
